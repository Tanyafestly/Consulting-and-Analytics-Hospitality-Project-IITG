# üè® Optimizing Revenue Leakage & Profitability in the Hospitality Sector

This is a business intelligence project built using Power BI that analyzes a large-scale hotel booking dataset to identify revenue leakage, cancellation trends, platform inefficiencies, and underutilized room capacity. The goal is to propose **data-backed strategies** that improve profitability and guest conversion in the hospitality industry.

---

## üéØ Objective

To analyze 135,000+ hotel bookings across cities, room categories, and booking platforms, and identify:
- Patterns in booking behavior
- Revenue leakage from cancellations
- Occupancy gaps and low-performing hotels
- Room preference trends

Using these insights, the project proposes 5 key recommendations backed by business metrics and scenario-based financial impact modeling.
